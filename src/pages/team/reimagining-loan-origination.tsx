            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
             The client, a regional retail bank with 180+ branches, was struggling with one simple yet expensive truth; loan applications moved slower than customer expectations. 



            </p>
              <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
          What should have taken minutes took days. Documents moved from desk to desk; approvals were lost in translation, and compliance checks dragged endlessly. 
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
          They needed speed. But more than that, they needed control. 
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="fw-bold" style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>The Challenge</h2>
            <ul style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              <li><strong>Manual Verification:</strong> Teams used to manually validate every document and customer input. </li>
              <li><strong>Inconsistent Risk Checks:</strong> Each branch applied its own rules, creating uneven decisions. </li>
              <li><strong>Customer Friction: </strong> Delays led to customer drop-offs in the middle of onboarding. </li>
              <li><strong>Audit Gaps: </strong> Compliance reports were generated long after approvals, creating risk exposure. </li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              The traditional re-engineering process wouldn‚Äôt fix this. The bank didn‚Äôt need another dashboard. 

            </p>
            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              
 They needed a self-orchestrating system; one that could execute, verify, and record simultaneously. 
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="fw-bold" style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>Our Solution</h2>

              For this bank, automation wasn‚Äôt about removing people; it was about freeing them.
