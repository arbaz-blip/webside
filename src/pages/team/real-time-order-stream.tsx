            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              A leading supply chain enterprise, managing thousands of daily orders across
              multiple sales platforms and logistics partners, was struggling with fragmented
              systems. Their order data was scattered, their tracking unreliable, and their
              teams constantly firefighting manual reconciliation issues.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              For a business where every delayed order means lost trust and revenue, this was
              more than inefficiency — it was a growth blocker.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="fw-bold" style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>The Challenge</h2>
            <ul style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              <li><strong>Fragmented Data:</strong> Multiple systems creating blind spots.</li>
              <li><strong>Inefficient Tracking:</strong> No real-time updates.</li>
              <li><strong>Manual Reconciliation:</strong> Hours wasted merging reports.</li>
              <li><strong>Scaling Pressure:</strong> Growth threatened customer satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Garet' }}>
              The client had worked with vendors before, but solutions were either overcomplicated
              or not designed for scale. They needed a partner who could align fast and deliver results.
